# Mole Simulator

A Java-based educational chemistry game where players identify chemical elements by their symbols. Help the mole learn chemistry while earning points and collecting items!

## Game Description

The Mole Simulator is an interactive educational game that helps players learn chemical elements. Players are presented with element symbols and must correctly identify the corresponding element names to earn points. 

## System Requirements

- **Java**: Java 8 or higher (tested with Java 22)
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory**: Minimum 512MB RAM

## Installation & Setup

1. **Download the project** to your local machine
2. **Ensure Java is installed**:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
## How to Run

### Option 1: Using Batch Files (Windows - Recommended)

Navigate to the `mole/dist/` directory and double-click one of these files:
- `run-mole.bat` - Runs the original jar file
- `run-mole-fixed.bat` - Runs the fixed jar file with proper manifest

### Option 2: Command Line

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the `mole/dist/` directory:

```bash
cd "path/to/mole-simulator-main/mole/dist"
```

Then run one of these commands:

**For the original jar:**
```bash
java -cp "mole.jar;lib\AbsoluteLayout.jar" frmHome
```

**For the fixed jar:**
```bash
java -cp "mole-fixed.jar;lib\AbsoluteLayout.jar" frmHome
```

**For Linux/macOS users:**
```bash
java -cp "mole.jar:lib/AbsoluteLayout.jar" frmHome
```

### Option 3: Direct Jar Execution (Fixed Version Only)

If you're using the `mole-fixed.jar` file:
```bash
java -jar mole-fixed.jar
```
